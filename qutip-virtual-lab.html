Exploring simple quantum systems with QuTiP can help build intuition for them,
but there are many cases where writing code and Jupyter notebooks can get
in the way:

- When teaching, coding can be a big distraction. Quantum mechanics is complex
  enough without your students having to struggle with installing software,
  messing up their notebooks or learn QuTiP at the same time.

- When doing research, coding can be a big detour. You just want to do a quick
  check to remind yourself how a simple system works, not spend the afternoon
  fiddling in a text editor. You have papers to write and grant reports to fill
  in. Time is precious.

- When at a party or while pitching you cool ideas, you don't want to take out
  your laptop to show people how cool your ideas are. It breaks the flow. You
  need to be able to show them on your tablet.

For all of these use cases, there is QuTiP Virtual Lab -- a tablet and web
optimized graphical interface for building and exploring simple quantum systems.

It runs entirely in your browser, so there's no server and nothing to install.

There's a handy tutorial with videos included in the virtual lab itself and some pre-built systems
to get you started.
