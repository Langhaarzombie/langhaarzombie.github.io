## Position for a QuTiP developer / Technical Staff, Full Time (on-site in Japan)

The *Quantum Information Physics Theory Research Team* led by Dr. Franco Nori is a team of theoretical physicists working on topics in quantum computing, 
machine learning, quantum optics, and condensed matter.
It is also the origin of one of the world's most popular open-source quantum software packages -- QuTiP.
The group is based at RIKEN, a national research institute in Japan, located close to Tokyo.

### ROLE - TECHNICAL STAFF

We are hiring developers/technical staff to assist in the further development of our open-source quantum toolbox called QuTiP.  
This involves a broad range of tasks, and requires knowledge of both quantum physics and open-source software development.  
Current priorities include the full release of QuTiP v5, and the improvement of the performance of solvers and circuit simulators within QuTiP by adding support for GPUs (using e.g., CuPy, Jax etc) and HPC. 
Employment period is flexible in a range between 3-12 months.

Compensation is competitive with academic community standards and will depend on the candidate experience (PhD graduate or not, etc.). 
This position is based in Japan and will be employed by RIKEN, in Wako-shi campus close to Tokyo. 
The candidates will work with members of the RIKEN team and the international QuTiP development team.

### ABOUT YOU:

 * Experience with Python-focused mathematics or scientific software engineering in industry or academia (not necessarily quantum related), or an undergraduate or masters degree in a related topic.
 * Experience contributing to open-source software packages.

### BONUS:

 * Familiarity with open-source quantum simulation packages like QuTiP, Qiskit, etc.
 * Experience with GPU-focused software development (CUDA, OpenCL, CuPy, JAX, etc), particularly as applied to solving large systems of ODEs, linear equations, etc.
 * Masters/PhD-level experience of research in quantum physics (quantum computing, open quantum systems, quantum optics related).

### Contact

Applicants should contact fnori@riken.jp, ais@riken.jp and nwlambert@riken.jp directly with a CV and cover letter.
